                <h2>How much money should I bring?</h2>
                <p>Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what you wish to purchase. If driving, there's a $5 charge for parking. Plan to eat at the festival? You may want to bring at least $10. Prices vary by vendor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can I pay with a credit card?</h2>
                <p>Most vendors accept credit cards, but it's a good idea to bring some cash as a backup.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can I bring my dog?</h2>
                <p>Bringing a dog is strongly discouraged due to pets not being allowed on the Commons. Additionally, the event will be crowded and may be overwhelming for your furry friend, or it may be difficult to move through the crowds. Registered service animals are permitted.</p>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What should I wear?</h2>
                <p>If you are not familiar with the Ithaca area, it can get quite cold in the fall! Check the weather and bring layers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>When is the best time to attend?</h2>
                <p>If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Will there be alcohol?</h2>
                <p>Some vendors do sell alcohol (such as hard cider), so be sure to bring your ID if you are over 21. Many of these vendors also offer tastings.</p>
